# LUNA-A430Ai [Tenshi-Edition]

Welcome! LUNA-A430 is a friendly and conversational AI chatbot designed to run in the Windows terminal. Luna functions on numerous APIs, pulling data from a range of local and external databases. This includes but is not limited to the Wiki database, casual conversational dialect (local JSON), and emotion database. 
LUNA is not desighned to be informative at all, and is not super advanced Be patient, Luna is still in early development. (I have hidden easter eggs)

# Install = + = + = + = + = + = + = + = + 
- Move The Luna folder, all files to root C:\
- Run The Shortcut (will not run properly otherwise)
- Luna then should Launch as expected

The source code I have provided for the entity extractor feature preview (to be implemented) and Soon, The Main Luna Code are not true to the real versions due to sensitive data such as API keys, and have been altered accordingly. If you want to become a contributor or an alpha tester you can find me on Discord, just add me. Username: @ok.zero. Luna's responses can be directly misleading, so fact-check important information. If you notice Luna repeating phrases, these are usually pre-programmed responses, but not allways, Luna sometimes takes the traning data literally and so will sometimes get confused. (Luna May Not work as expected on windows 11)

Alternative Launch:

```start "C:\LUNA-A430Ai\LUNA-Tenshi-Launcher.lnk" ```
