# LUNA-A430Ai [Tenshi-Edition]

(yes i will drop the first luna release in the following days)

Welcome! LUNA-A430 is a friendly and conversational AI chatbot designed to run in the Windows terminal. Luna functions on numerous APIs, pulling data from a range of local and external databases. This includes but is not limited to the Wiki database, casual conversational dialect (local JSON), and emotion database. Unlike your typical AI, Luna works a bit differently. Luna extracts individual entities within queries and accesses articles; this, in turn, allows Luna to build a response from a more select range of information to provide a more accurate and relevant summary.

The source code I have provided for the entity extractor feature preview and Luna are not true to the real versions due to sensitive data leaks such as API keys, and have been altered accordingly. If you want to become a contributor you can find me on Discord, just add me. Username: @ok.zero. Luna's responses can be directly misleading, so fact-check important information. If you notice Luna repeating phrases, these are usually pre-programmed responses, but not always; sometimes she just says the same thing when prompted with familiar or similar queries. And if Luna reacts to your message unrelated to the query she may be discerning the preprogrammed bot context along with your message as one message instead of separately. Be patient, Luna is still in early development.
