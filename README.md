The main branch are all my projects files not intened for use just for viewing. If you want to become a contributor or an alpha tester you can find me on Discord, just add me. Username: @ok.zero. Luna's responses can be directly misleading, so fact-check important information. If you notice Luna repeating phrases, these are usually pre-programmed responses, but not allways, Luna sometimes takes the traning data literally and so will sometimes get confused. (Luna May Not work as expected on windows 11)

**Alternative Launch:**

```start "C:\LUNA-A430Ai\LUNA-Tenshi-Launcher.lnk" ```
