# LUNA-A430Ai [Tenshi-Edition]

Welcome! LUNA-A430 is a friendly and conversational AI chatbot designed to run in the Windows terminal. Luna functions on numerous APIs, pulling data from a range of local and external databases. This includes but is not limited to the Wiki database, casual conversational dialect (local JSON), and emotion database. 

# Install
- Move The Luna folder, all files to root C:\
- Run The Shortcut (will not run properly otherwise)
- Luna then should Launch as expected

# Additional
The source code I have provided for the entity extractor feature preview (to be implemented) and Soon, The Main Luna Code are not true to the real versions due to sensitive data such as API keys, and have been altered accordingly. If you want to become a contributor or an alpha tester you can find me on Discord, just add me. Username: @ok.zero. Luna's responses can be directly misleading, so fact-check important information. If you notice Luna repeating phrases, these are usually pre-programmed responses, but not always. Be patient, Luna is still in early development. (Might Not work as expected on windows 11)
