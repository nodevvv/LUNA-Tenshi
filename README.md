# LUNA-A430Ai

Welcome! LUNA-A430 is a friendly and conversational AI chatbot designed to run in the Windows terminal. Luna functions on numerous APIs, pulling data from a range of local and external databases. This includes but is not limited to the Wiki database, casual conversational dialect (local JSON), and emotion database. Unlike your typical AI, Luna works a bit differently. Luna extracts individual entities within queries and accesses articles; this, in turn, allows Luna to build a response from a more select range of information to provide a more accurate and relevant summary.
